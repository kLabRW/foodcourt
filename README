Getting Started.
These instructions are for Unix/OS X, you will have to modify these a bit to get going on Windows. Consult your favorite Windows Python guru for details.

1. Check out the repository:

  `% git clone git://github.com/nyaruka/F4L.git`
  % cd f4l

2. Create a virtual environment and active it:

  % virtualenv env
  % source env/bin/activate

3. Initialize it with all the required libraries:

  % pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Initialize our database:

  % python manage.py syncdb

5.  Start the server:

  % python manage.py runserver

You should now be able to load and interact with the F4L website at: http://localhost:8000/

Don't mind the design so far.its very basic..
